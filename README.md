# Auth server

This is a generic node authentication server

## Use case

Clone this repo to get a basic directory structure ready. The `package.json` file does contain extra packages like mongoose,ioredis. So be sure to delete them before running npm install.
Later one can set this up to run over a API server. Or directly integrate with any database of choise like I was plannning to use MongoDB.
